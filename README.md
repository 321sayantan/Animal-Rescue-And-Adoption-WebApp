## Project Description

The Animal Adoption and Rescue Website allows users to browse available animals, view detailed information, and submit adoption applications. Admins can manage animal listings, view adoption requests, and update animal statuses.
## Features

- **Animal Adoption**: Users can browse and adopt animals available for rehoming.
- **Animal Rescue**: Volunteers within a 15 km radius are notified when an animal needs immediate rescue. This feature ensures that urgent cases are handled promptly by nearby volunteers.
- **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration for both users and admins.
- **Animal Listings**: Browse and filter animals available for adoption.
- **Animal Details**: View detailed information about each animal.
- **Adoption Applications**: Submit and manage adoption applications.
- **Admin Dashboard**: Manage animal listings and view adoption requests.
- **Light/dark mode toggle**

### How It Works:
1. **Animal Rescue Alerts**: When a new rescue request is created, the system calculates the location of the request and identifies volunteers within a 15 km radius.
2. **Notification System**: Volunteers within the specified range receive E-mail notifications about the rescue request, enabling them to respond quickly to the situation.

This application aims to improve the efficiency of animal rescue operations and connect animals in need with caring individuals who can help.
